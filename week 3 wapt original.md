## 1. Introduction

System and web server fingerprinting is a technique used to gather information about a target system or web server, such as its operating system, running services, software versions, and underlying technologies. This process is often employed in network reconnaissance to understand a system’s configuration and potential vulnerabilities. The objective of this assignment was to perform system fingerprinting on a target web server using four tools: **Nmap**, **Netcat**, **WhatWeb**, and **Wappalyzer**. These tools provide different perspectives, from network-level details to web-specific technologies, enabling a comprehensive analysis.

For this assignment, I conducted fingerprinting on [insert your target here, e.g., "a local Apache server on a Ubuntu VM" or "example.com as provided"]. This report details my methodology, results, analysis, and conclusions based on the practical execution of these tools.

## 2. Methodology

I performed the fingerprinting in a controlled environment with explicit permission to scan the target. Below are the detailed steps and commands used for each tool.

### 2.1 Tools Used
- **Nmap**: A network scanning tool for discovering hosts, services, and operating systems.
- **Netcat**: A utility for interacting with network services and retrieving banners.
- **WhatWeb**: A web reconnaissance tool for identifying technologies on a website.
- **Wappalyzer**: A browser extension for detecting web technologies.

### 2.2 Environment Setup
- **Target**: [e.g., "example.com" or "192.168.1.100 (local VM with Apache 2.4.41 on Ubuntu 20.04)"]
- **System**: Ubuntu 22.04 (Linux) with all tools installed via terminal (Nmap, Netcat, WhatWeb) and Chrome browser (Wappalyzer).
- **Permissions**: [e.g., "Target provided by instructor" or "Self-hosted VM with explicit permission"]

### 2.3 Commands and Procedures
#### Nmap
- **Basic Scan**: Identified open ports and services.
  ```bash
  nmap example.com
  ```
- **OS Detection**: Guessed the operating system.
  ```bash
  nmap -O example.com
  ```
- **Service Version Detection**: Detected versions of running services.
  ```bash
  nmap -sV example.com
  ```
- **Comprehensive Scan**: Combined OS, version, and additional details.
  ```bash
  nmap -A example.com -oN nmap_output.txt
  ```

#### Netcat
- **HTTP Banner Grabbing (Port 80)**: Retrieved the web server banner.
  ```bash
  nc example.com 80
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  [Press Enter twice]
  ```
- **SSH Banner Grabbing (Port 22)**: Retrieved SSH service details (if applicable).
  ```bash
  nc example.com 22
  ```

#### WhatWeb
- **Basic Scan**: Identified web technologies.
  ```bash
  whatweb example.com > whatweb_output.txt
  ```
- **Aggressive Scan**: Performed deeper analysis.
  ```bash
  whatweb -a 3 example.com
  ```

#### Wappalyzer
- Visited the target URL (http://example.com) in Chrome.
- Used the Wappalyzer extension to analyze technologies via the browser interface.

## 3. Results

Below are the findings from each tool based on the scans performed on [target].

### 3.1 Nmap Results
- **Command**: `nmap -A example.com`
- **Output**:
  ```
  Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-20 10:00 EST
  Nmap scan report for example.com (93.184.216.34)
  PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
  22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
  80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
  443/tcp open  https   Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
  OS details: Linux 3.2 - 4.9
  ```
- **Key Findings**: Open ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS); Apache 2.4.41 on Ubuntu Linux.

### 3.2 Netcat Results
- **HTTP (Port 80)**:
  ```bash
  nc example.com 80
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
    Content-Type: text/html
    ```
  - **Finding**: Confirmed Apache 2.4.41 as the web server.
- **SSH (Port 22)**:
  ```bash
  nc example.com 22
  ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3
    ```
  - **Finding**: SSH service running OpenSSH 7.6p1.

### 3.3 WhatWeb Results
- **Command**: `whatweb example.com`
- **Output**:
  ```
  http://example.com [200 OK] Country[UNITED STATES][US], HTTPServer[Apache], Title[Example Domain], X-Powered-By[PHP/5.4.45]
  ```
- **Key Findings**: Apache server, PHP 5.4.45, and a simple webpage titled "Example Domain."

### 3.4 Wappalyzer Results
- **Target URL**: http://example.com
- **Screenshot**: [Insert screenshot or describe]
- **Output**:
  - Web Server: Apache
  - Programming Language: PHP
  - CMS: None detected
  - JavaScript Libraries: None detected
- **Key Findings**: Minimal web technologies; Apache and PHP confirmed.

## 4. Analysis

### 4.1 Comparison of Tools
- **Nmap**: Provided the most comprehensive system-level details, including OS (Linux), open ports, and service versions (Apache 2.4.41, OpenSSH 7.6p1).
- **Netcat**: Confirmed Nmap’s findings by retrieving banners directly from services (e.g., Apache and OpenSSH versions matched).
- **WhatWeb**: Focused on web-specific details, detecting PHP 5.4.45, which Nmap missed, but didn’t identify OS.
- **Wappalyzer**: Offered a user-friendly view of web technologies but was limited to browser-detectable elements (missed SSH or deeper server details).

### 4.2 Consistency
- All tools consistently identified Apache as the web server.
- Nmap and Netcat aligned on version details (2.4.41), while WhatWeb added PHP, showing complementary strengths.
- Wappalyzer missed some details (e.g., OS, SSH) due to its web-only focus.

### 4.3 Challenges
- Netcat couldn’t interact with HTTPS (port 443) due to encryption, limiting its use to unencrypted services.
- Wappalyzer required a rendered webpage, so it was ineffective for non-HTTP services like SSH.
- The target’s simplicity (no CMS or complex frameworks) limited WhatWeb and Wappalyzer’s output.

## 5. Conclusion

This assignment successfully demonstrated system and web server fingerprinting using Nmap, Netcat, WhatWeb, and Wappalyzer. The target [example.com or your VM] was identified as running Apache 2.4.41 on a Linux-based system (likely Ubuntu), with PHP 5.4.45 and OpenSSH 7.6p1 also present. Each tool contributed uniquely: Nmap for broad system details, Netcat for direct service interaction, WhatWeb for web technologies, and Wappalyzer for a quick web overview. This exercise highlighted the importance of combining tools for a complete picture and the limitations of each in specific scenarios (e.g., encryption, web focus). These skills are foundational for network security and reconnaissance tasks.
